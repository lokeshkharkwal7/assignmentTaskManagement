### Assignment React Task Management CRUD App with MERN Stack 
This project is a full-fledged React application that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data, leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and provides advanced features like searching and a responsive user interface.

Node.js and npm (or yarn):
Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en
npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js installation.
Optional: Install yarn (an alternative package manager): https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/

Project Features

Comprehensive CRUD Operations:
Create new data entries with intuitive forms or user interfaces.
Read existing data entries, efficiently displaying them in tables or relevant formats.
Update existing data entries through clear editing functionalities.
Delete data entries with confirmation prompts and appropriate security measures.
MERN Stack Integration:
Uses MongoDB as the primary database for data persistence.
Employs Express.js to handle server-side logic and create robust API endpoints for CRUD operations.
Leverages React.js to build the interactive and dynamic user interface.
Utilizes Node.js as the runtime environment to execute the server-side code.
Advanced Search Functionality:
Implements a search bar or similar mechanism to allow users to filter data based on specific criteria.
